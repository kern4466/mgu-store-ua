# shutdown_mark.sh — run by var-opt-ro.service (drop-in
# 50-waze-on-cluster.conf) at each head-unit shutdown, before /var/opt goes
# read-only. recmgr's reboot after a crash and a switch-off are both an NSM
# fast shutdown that stops no service, so each patched service's state at
# that moment tells them apart for boot recovery (recovery.js): it writes
# "<boot id> running|failed|stopped" for carplay.service to <state
# dir>/shutdown and for aapd.service to <state dir>/shutdown-aapd. failed is
# a Result other than success, except a SIGKILL of aapd (Result signal,
# ExecMainCode 2, status 9; an oom-kill stays failed), which its watcher takes for no crash either: aapd.service has no
# SuccessExitStatus=SIGKILL, as carplay.service's drop-in gives carplay. It
# writes nothing for a service whose state cannot be read within WAIT
# seconds, and always exits 0, so it never holds up the remount.
