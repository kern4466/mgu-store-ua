/* MapFeed: the decoded map as a video layer of the shared cluster renderer
 * (cluster-render, its PROTOCOL.md), and what the Waze app is told about it.
 *
 * One video layer, class content and contending with the stock map, on the
 * target the map goes to: `map` (the native central-map slot 0x100, whose
 * 1088x480 scene the map fills) unless a control start chose another; on a
 * whole-panel target it is the centred map area (map_geometry.h), on the
 * HUD the HUD's rect (hud_rect), else the centred map area too. With
 * also_hud, a map on the cluster (map or panel) is drawn on the HUD too: a
 * second video layer at the HUD's rect, given a copy of every frame and
 * shown and hidden with the first. The status follows the first; the
 * second's states are logged.
 * The renderer draws every frame the way waze-on-cluster always has (one
 * persistent R8 atlas written in changed tiles, packed fast motion, the
 * frame clock, newest frame only) within the budget all its clients share,
 * and maps the slot from the first frame the visible layer has. The layer
 * is visible while CarPlay's cluster stream is live, not frozen and shows a
 * picture (set_stream, freeze_watch.h): hidden, the renderer keeps taking
 * its frames but lets the slot go, and the stock map comes back. stall_ms, which
 * releases the slot once the frames stop that long, is only a backstop,
 * since how often a static map sends a frame depends on the phone (one about
 * every ten seconds, another about 30 a second). Frames handed
 * over while the renderer is not reachable are dropped; the client
 * reconnects by itself and the next frame shows.
 *
 * The app's status line follows the stream, the layer and its target: idle
 * until the first frame or while the stream is not live, idle with kWaiting
 * while the stream's picture is blank, frozen while the stream is, starting
 * while the slot is asked for or held by the stock map and while the
 * renderer starts, showing with the frames handed over a second, error when
 * the renderer refused the layer or stays unreachable. Showing, and idle
 * while the stream is live, carry the stream's own reason (stream_health.h:
 * the stream lost) when it has one, in place of kWaiting. */
