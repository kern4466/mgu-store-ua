/* The mapping guard (README.md "Mapping guard"): a mapping the cluster
 * cannot take can make the KOMBI restart the cluster and the HUD, and the
 * service would map it again after every restart and every boot.
 *
 * A mapping is a target's (slot, scene id, content class). The slot manager
 * calls strike() against a mapping it holds to blame (slots.h). At its
 * target's strike_limit strikes the mapping is disabled: never asked for
 * again until cluster-render's version changes or the file is removed
 * (`cluster-render guard-reset`). A target with a strike_limit of 0, and the
 * map's mapping in slot 0x100 with scene 0x010004f0 whatever its limit,
 * only has its strikes counted and logged, also when the file says
 * otherwise. A strike stops counting once kCleanBoots boots have passed
 * without another against the same mapping; a disabled mapping keeps its
 * strikes.
 *
 * The strikes and the disabled mappings are kept in a file, written whole,
 * renamed into place and its folder synced at each change, so a boot never
 * asks for a disabled mapping. A file of another version is started over,
 * and so is one that cannot be read, with a warning; a file that cannot be
 * written leaves the guard working from memory, with a warning. */
